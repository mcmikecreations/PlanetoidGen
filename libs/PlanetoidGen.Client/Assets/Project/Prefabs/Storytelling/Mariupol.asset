    Relative
    estimates of the destruction of Mariupol are greatly exaggerated and they are
    smaller than in the same Popasnaya or Rubizhnye, but in absolute terms, Mariupol
    is the sad leader in terms of the number of destroyed buildings and victims among
    the civilian population. For example, the southern and northern parts of the
    city survived quite a bit, but the center, the Azovstal district and the neighborhoods/quarters
    west of the center were destroyed and burned.

    

    According to various
    estimates, the garrison of the city consisted of 4,000 to 8,000 soldiers, of
    which approximately 1,400 were soldiers of the "Azov" regiment. For the defense
    of a city with half a million inhabitants, this is a meager figure. Ten times
    more is needed, but this is precisely the feat of the defenders of Mariupol,
    who did not give up until May 18 that they were able to do 10 times more than
    they could. Having shown superhuman efforts and professionalism in defense planning,
    our fighters managed to organize an exemplary defense.
