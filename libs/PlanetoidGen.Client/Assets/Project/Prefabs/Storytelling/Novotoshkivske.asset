    From February
    15 to 24, the positions in this area were under heavy shelling, and intelligence
    recorded a significant build-up of equipment. With the beginning of a full-scale
    invasion, assaults on forward positions began with forces that greatly outnumbered
    ours. As a participant of those battles said:

    <i>"the fire was so intense
    that, for example, at the 29th checkpoint, the concrete capsules were completely
    buried in the ground... every day they used up as much ammunition as we didn''t
    use up in a month."</i>
