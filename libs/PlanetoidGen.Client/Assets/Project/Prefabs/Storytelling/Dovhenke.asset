  _text: "<size=28px><b>Dovhenke</b></size>\n\nBefore the war, all of us saw shooters
    who painted katsaps with a \"cauldron for the ATO/OSS group\". Plans to encircle
    DonUR existed and they died in Dovgenky. It was there that the enemy was detained
    for a long time. Although as a result the Armed Forces withdrew from the village,
    which was left with the bare walls of destroyed buildings, the further movement
    of the Katsaps towards Barvinkovo was not only difficult, but also lost its strategic
    value. Dovgenka and the battles around the village are a really important page
    in the history of the war.\r\n\r\nOf course, the entire line from Velika Komyshuvakha
    to Bogorodychny showed heroism and in no way do we want to belittle the sacrifices
    of others, because among them are our subscribers who were in hell in the same
    Valley.\n\nThis satellite image shows a 40-metre\_crater\_in Dovhenke, Ukraine,
